    """
    The main goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient solution for detecting phishing emails from a large dataset of text-based messages. Phishing emails, which are often used for fraudulent activities like stealing personal information or spreading malware, are a common threat. This system is intended to automate the detection process, enabling users to quickly and accurately identify phishing attempts with minimal human intervention.
    \nThe project employs several technologies and tools to build and deploy the model:

1. **Python Libraries**:
    - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling the dataset.
    - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
    - **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning, including model training, feature extraction (**CountVectorizer**), and classification (**Multinomial Naive Bayes**).
2. **Streamlit**: For building an intuitive web interface, allowing users to interact with the model and receive predictions in real-time.
3. **CountVectorizer**: Used for converting text data (email messages) into numerical features suitable for the machine learning model.
    
**Application to CGC**: Email security for internal and external Communications
\n**Purpose**: Protect employees from phishing attacks in emails, especially since CGC likely deals with sensitive financial and personal information.
\n**How**: How: The model can be used to automatically analyze incoming emails to CGC employees. Emails flagged as "Phishing" can be routed to a security team for further analysis or can trigger an automatic alert to warn the recipient. This could protects CGC employees from opening fraudulent emails that could lead to data breaches, financial loss, or malware installation.

    The goal of this ML model is to predict whether a loan customer will become **Month-In-Arrears (MIA)** in the next 3 months. The goal is to help the Guarantee Monitoring & Reporting (GMR) Department proactively monitor and manage loan defaults.

\n **Objective**: Predict if a customer will be MIA (i.e., miss payments) in the next 3 months based on historical loan and customer data.\n
**Data**: The model uses features such as loan amount, guarantee cover amount, outstanding balance, interest rate, race, bumi status, constitution, sector, scheme group, and financial entity.\n
**Label**: The target variable is created by checking if a customer (grouped by appl_no) has a MIA event in the next 3 months.\n
**Algorithm**: The model uses a **RandomForestClassifier** from scikit-learn, which is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees.\n
